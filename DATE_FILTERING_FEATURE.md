# Date Filtering Feature for Applications

## Overview
The admin applications page now includes comprehensive date filtering capabilities that allow administrators to filter applications by various date ranges.

## Available Date Filters

### Quick Date Filters
- **Today**: Shows applications submitted today
- **Yesterday**: Shows applications submitted yesterday  
- **This Week**: Shows applications submitted in the current week (Monday to Sunday)
- **This Month**: Shows applications submitted in the current month
- **Last Month**: Shows applications submitted in the previous month
- **Last 3 Months**: Shows applications submitted in the last 3 months

### Custom Date Range
- **Custom Range**: Allows administrators to specify a custom start and end date
  - Start Date: The beginning of the date range
  - End Date: The end of the date range
  - Validation ensures start date is not after end date

## How to Use

### Using Quick Date Filters
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Manage Applications
2. In the "Date Filter" dropdown, select your desired date range
3. The applications will automatically filter based on your selection
4. You can combine this with other filters (Status, Department, Search)

### Using Custom Date Range
1. Select "Custom Range" from the Date Filter dropdown
2. Two new date input fields will appear
3. Select your desired start date
4. Select your desired end date
5. Click "Apply Filters" to see the results

### Clearing Filters
- Use "Clear All Filters" to reset all filters including date filters
- Use "Clear Dates" (when custom range is selected) to clear only the date inputs

## Visual Indicators

### Active Filters Display
When filters are applied, a blue indicator bar shows:
- Which filters are currently active
- The specific values selected for each filter
- A "Clear All" button to quickly reset all filters

## Technical Implementation

GET /admin/applications?date_filter=custom_range&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31
```
